                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Logan Walsh, a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Auckland.
                    I've worked across many industries including hospitality, consulting, teaching, and software development, which have taught me the value of collaboration, open communication and lifelong learning.
                    I'm eager to learn from experienced engineers, contribute to meaningful projects, and continue growing as a Software Developer and as a person.
